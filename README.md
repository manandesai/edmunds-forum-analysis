Involves the following steps/approaches:
1. Selenium to scrape forum and fetch posts
2. Finds most popular brands mentioned (accounting for model names)
3. Calculates lifts (associations) between brands
4. Generates an MDS map
5. Analyzes most frequently mentioned attributes for each brand
6. Attempts to find *aspirational* brands (i.e. cars that users *want to* purchase)
